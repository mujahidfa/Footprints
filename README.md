## Inspiration
I wanted to build something that I would actually use. And small enough for me to do on my own. And looks good.

## What it does
It tells you your carbon footprint when you search for navigation on Google Maps.

## How I built it
A hint of Chrome API, a sprinkle of Vue, a dash of TailwindCSS, and a waterfall of tears

Huge shoutouts to the people who made [CarbonKit API](https://docs.carbonkit.net/), and special thanks to [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator) for providing all the comparison data.

## Challenges I ran into
Chrome API's docs (or lack thereof)

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I'm quite proud with the UI. I spent a lot of my time doing that. And I think it looks good

## What I learned
I learned that TailwindCSS is amazing, and Chrome API is.. something that I probably would not touch no more in the near future.

## What's next for Footprints
- To add support for flights and buses/trains/public transport. 
- To publish it on Chrome App Store so that I can have my friends use it.
